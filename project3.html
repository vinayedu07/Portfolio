            <h3>R&D on Subsonic Aircraft Aerodynamics</h3>
            <p><strong>Project Focus:</strong> Conducted daily testing and simulations for R&D on subsonic aircraft. Emphasis on improving aerodynamic wing efficiency through inner and outer region flaps study.</p>
            <p><strong>Prototype Development (P4V1-6): </strong>Developed Prototype 4 Versions 1-6, focusing on the inner region flaps, specifically Alpha flap and Beta flap. Schematic diagram illustrates the placement of Beta Flap for enhanced aerodynamic features.</p>
            <p><strong>Feature Enhancement Ratio: </strong>Prototype 2 Versions (9-14) and Prototype 4 Versions (1-6) share the same feature enhancement ratio. Features analyzed in XY and Z directions for aerodynamicity.</p>
            <p><strong>Result Analysis - Alpha Flap (P4V1-6): </strong>Discrete data from December-October 2022 analyzed for Inner Region Flap (Alpha). Study reveals that a combination of aerodynamic and non-aerodynamic features leads to high and stable efficiency.</p>
            <p><strong>Result Analysis - Beta Flap (P4V1-6): </strong>Average Efficiency comparison for Beta Flap in six prototypes (P4V1-6). Highlights differences among prototypes, aiding in design optimization.</p>
            <p><strong>Comment on Current Results: </strong>Focuses on the design aspect of the feature. Non-flat surface design observed to yield higher efficiency and stability in adverse flight conditions.</p>
            <p><strong>Conclusion: </strong>This project delves into the intricacies of subsonic aircraft aerodynamics, specifically addressing the design and efficiency of inner region flaps. The findings from Alpha and Beta flap analyses contribute to the ongoing efforts in enhancing aerodynamic performance and stability.</p>
