          <h3>Recapitulation of Thermal Power Station</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Project Summary:</strong> The project delves into the intricacies of the Rankine cycle, distinguishing between supercritical and subcritical cycles. Processes such as pumping, heating, expansion, and condensation are discussed for a holistic view of the thermal power station's efficiency.<br><br>
    
            <strong>Coal Handling and Transportation:</strong> A 12km railway line facilitates the transportation of coal to the power station, underscoring the significance of efficient coal handling. The project outlines a comprehensive coal handling system, covering delivery, unloading, preparation, transfer, storage, and firing methods.<br><br>
    
            <strong>Key Components and Processes:</strong> Detailed insights are provided into crucial components like boilers, low-pressure heaters, feed water cycles, and cooling water cycles. Emphasis on the demineralization of water, auxiliary cooling water system, and the role of compressors enriches the understanding of the power generation process.<br><br>
    
            <strong>Turbine Efficiency Analysis:</strong> The efficiency and work generated by high-pressure, intermediate pressure, and low-pressure turbines are calculated. Specific findings for each turbine (HP, IP, LP) showcase their individual contributions to the overall efficiency of the power station.<br><br>
    
            <strong>Conclusion and Key Findings:</strong> The intern reflects on the observed differences between theoretical and practical power stations. Noteworthy points include the importance of maintaining backup parts, strategic sensor placements, and the functioning of safety monitoring systems in real power plants.<br><br>
    
            <strong>Conclusion:</strong> From this internship, key observations reveal the critical role of practical considerations in power station operations, emphasizing the need for meticulous planning, backup systems, and advanced safety measures.<br><br>
    
            <strong>Key Findings:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>1. Practical power stations require meticulous maintenance of backup parts for major components.</li>
              <li>2. Sensors are strategically placed throughout the system for efficient monitoring.</li>
              <li>3. Real power plants employ robust safety monitoring systems to ensure operational integrity.</li>
            </ul><br><br>
    
            <strong>Turbine Efficiency Metrics:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>High-Pressure Turbine:</strong> Work Generated (W1): 188,326.298 Mcal/Hr | Efficiency (η): 81.86%</li>
              <li><strong>Intermediate Pressure Turbine:</strong> Work Generated (W2): 272,456.99 Mcal/Hr | Efficiency (η): 93.2%</li>
              <li><strong>Low Pressure Turbine:</strong> Work Generated (W3): 215,645.204 Mcal/Hr | Efficiency (η): 90.4%</li>
