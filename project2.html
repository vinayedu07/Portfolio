  <h3>Material Removal Manufacturing</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Project Summary:</strong> Non-Traditional Machining Processes:
    Electrolytic machining, laser machining, and electron beam machining are employed for challenging materials and intricate shapes. Benefits include high energy density, strong penetration, and precision at molecular or atomic levels.<br><br>

    <strong>CNC Machining:</strong> CNC machines use computer programs for automated control, driven by components like DC and servo motors, stepper motors, and actuators.<br><br>

    <strong>Milling Process:</strong> Milling machines are crucial for producing parts with flat, curved, and intricate shapes. Two milling processes, up milling and down milling, cater to specific machining needs.<br><br>

    <strong>Heat Treatment:</strong> Various heat treatment methods, such as annealing, normalizing, hardening, tempering, and surface hardening, enhance material properties. Annealing involves controlled heating and slow cooling for a coarse pearlite structure.<br><br>

    <strong>Surface Roughness Measurement:</strong> Diverse methods like taper sectioning, glass measurement, diffraction techniques, tactile tests, pneumatic gauging, and optical sections are employed for surface roughness measurement.<br><br>

    <strong>Measurement and Calibration:</strong> Precision factors like exact size, approximate size, error of measurement, and sensitivity are pivotal for achieving industrial economy and part interchangeability.<br><br>

    <strong>Conclusion:</strong> This project provides a comprehensive overview of material removal manufacturing, emphasizing non-traditional machining, CNC processes, milling, heat treatment, surface roughness measurement, and measurement/calibration techniques. The integration of these processes is crucial for achieving precision and efficiency in industrial manufacturing.<br><br>
